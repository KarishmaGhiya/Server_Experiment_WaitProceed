           <h3> In this task you will be working together with other people in your group to solve a challenging puzzle. When the task begins you will be given the puzzle (everyone in your group is

working on the same puzzle) and some clues to help solve the puzzle. You will also

be provided with a shared spreadsheet to mark down your guesses and answers

(everyone in your group will be able to see and edit the same spreadsheet).</h3>

<h3>You will also be able to communicate with other Turkers in your group. Depending

on your condition you will either be able to communicate using a group chat or an

online forum. You will be able to type and submit messages to your group. They will

see your messages (and you will see theirs) soon after they are submitted. We

encourage you to use the communication channel to work together to solve this

challenging problem.</h3>

<h3>Groups that successfully solve the problem will be given a bonus.</h3>
